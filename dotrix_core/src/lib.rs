pub mod components {
//! Component usually is just a data structure with or without associated methods. In ECS
//! pattern components represent properties of entities: velocity, weight, model, rigid body, color
//! etc.
//!
//! Set of components in the entity defines an Archetype. Entities of the same
//! Archetype are being grouped together in the [`crate::services::World`] storage, that
//! makes search fast and linear.
//!
//! When planning the architecture of your game, developer should think about components not only
//! as of properties, but also as of search tags. For example, if you are making physics for your
//! game, and you have a `Car` and a `SpringBoard`, you may want to have the same named components,
//! so you can easily query all `Cars` or all `SpringBoards`. But as soon as you will need to
//! calculate physics for entities of the both types, you should add some component like 
//! `RigidBody` to the entities, so you can calculate physics for all entities who have that
//! component.
//!
//! ## Usefull references
//! - To learn how to spawn and query entities, continue reading with [`crate::services::World`]
//! - To learn how to implement systems [`crate::systems`]

pub mod services {
//! Services are very important part of Dotrix. Technicaly the service is a standard Rust
//! structure with methods. Logically, services are providers of interfaces to various
//! features.
//!
//! Developer should explicitly create an instance of a service and add it to a game using the
//! [`crate::Dotrix`] application builder:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use dotrix_core::{
//!     Dotrix,
//!     services::{ World },
//! };
//!
//! // in fn main()
//! Dotrix::application("My Game")
//!     .with_service(World::default())
//!     .run();
//!
//! ```
//! After adding a service to your game you can access it inside of [`crate::systems`].
//!

    pub use crate::{
        assets::Assets,
        camera::Camera,
        input::Input,
        frame::Frame,
        input::Ray,
        renderer::Renderer,
        window::Window,
        world::World,
    };
}

pub mod systems {
//! Systems implement logic of your game. A system take a set of [`crate::services`] as
//! parameters and implements a feature. For example, here is a system that moves camera by X
//! axis if Right mouse button is pressed:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use dotrix_core::{
//!     Dotrix,
//!     input::{ ActionMapper, Button, State as InputState, Mapper }, 
//!     ecs::{ Const, Mut, System },
//!     services::{ Camera, Frame, Input }, 
//! };
//!
//! // camera moving system
//! pub fn camera_move_x(mut camera: Mut<Camera>, input: Const<Input>, frame: Const<Frame>) {
//!     let time_delta = frame.delta().as_secs_f32();
//!
//!     if input.button_state(Button::MouseRight) == Some(InputState::Hold) {
//!         camera.target.x += 1.0 * time_delta;
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     Dotrix::application("My Game")
//!         // add system to yout application
//!         .with_system(System::from(camera_move_x))
//!         // services should also be there
//!         .with_service(Camera::default())
//!         .with_service(Frame::default())
//!         .with_service(Input::new(Box::new(Mapper::<Action>::new())))
//!         .run();
//! }
//!
//! // Mapping is required for the Input service
//! #[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Clone, Copy, Hash)]
//! enum Action {}
//!
//! impl ActionMapper<Action> for Input {
//!     fn action_mapped(&self, action: Action) -> Option<&Button> {
//!         let mapper = self.mapper::<Mapper<Action>>();
//!         mapper.get_button(action)
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! [`crate::ecs::Mut`] and [`crate::ecs::Const`] are just the accessors for services to keep
//! Rust mutability controls. The set of services that system takes as arguments is up to
//! developer. It can be effortlessly extended at any time. The order of [`crate::services`] in
//! arguments list does not matter.
//!
//! What is also important to mention here, is that all services used in systems must be added
//! to your game using the application builder.
//!
//! ## Systems with context
//!
//! Sometimes it is usefull to preserve some data between system executions. It can be done using
//! a [`crate::Service`], but it has sense only when the data has to be shared between different
//! systems. Otherwise it is better to use the [`crate::ecs::Context`].
//!
//! System can have only one context and if it does, the context must be always passed as a first
//! argument. Another requirement is that [`crate::ecs::Context`] structure must implement the
//! `Default` trait.
//!
//! ## Example
//! ```no_run
//! use dotrix_core::{
//!     ecs::Context,
//! };
//!
//! #[derive(Default)]
//! struct Counter {
//!     value: usize,
//! }
//!
//! fn count_up(mut counter: Context<Counter>) {
//!     counter.value += 1;
//!     println!("The `counter_up` system has been called {} times", counter.value);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## System run levels
//!
//! Developer can affect the execution of systems by assigning them specific run levels.
//! If [`crate::ecs::RunLevel`] is not set explicitly, the `RunLevel::Standard` will be used.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use dotrix_core::{
//!     Dotrix,
//!     services::Assets,
//!     ecs::{ Mut, System, RunLevel },
//! };
//!
//! fn init_game(mut assets: Mut<Assets>) {
//!     println!("Starting my super game");
//!     assets.import("/path/to/my/asset.png");
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     Dotrix::application("My Game")
//!         .with_system(System::from(init_game).with(RunLevel::Startup))
//!         .with_service(Assets::new())
//!         .run();
//! }
//! ```
